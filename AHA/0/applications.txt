Possible Applications of the UUID4-31 Format
============================================

    -   Unique identifiers for the C programming language [1]

Notes
-----

[1] "The implementation shall be able to translate and execute
        at least one program that contains at least one instance
        of every one of the following limits... 31 significant
        initial characters in an external identifier" (N2176,
        5.2.4.1 Translation limits). An identifier containing
        other than digits, letters, and underscore may not be
        portable (N2176, 6.4.2.1 General: Semantics).
